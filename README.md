 # Film Query Project

  This project was completed as a requirement in the Skill Distillery program.
  It demonstrates basic proficiency in using Java and ORM with JDBC to retrieve
  data from a pre-supplied database running on MAMP. Queries were made using
  MySQL and Maven was used to manage the project.

 ### How to run

  This project runs using a pre-supplied relational database: sdvid. Running this project on your own
  may not be feasible without access to an identical copy and setup of this database. Maven was used for
  project management and to handle the dependencies, which are located in the POM file. Java was used in
  in order to take advantage of the JDBC API.

 ### What did I learn?

  This project introduced so many technologies and concepts to me. By this point in the program
  I have become very comfortable with JAVA and OOP. My grasp of JAVA fundamentals allowed me to
  really focus on what was new. This included relational databases, SQL queries using MySQL, the
  Object Relational Model, and the JAVA Database Connectivity API. All of this was pulled together
  to create this simple, yet robust Film Query App.

 ### Further thoughts

  I was very excited to begin learning SQL, or more specifically MySQL. The language seems powerful
  and flexible. I loved being able to formulate a query and watch how fast it could literally display
  very, very large amounts of information in easy to read tables. Merging this with JAVA using the JDBC
  API and the concept of ORM felt very comfortable. It seemed to naturally fit into OOP and I can definitely
  foresee how these technologies in tandem can allow for the creation of very powerful pieces of code.
